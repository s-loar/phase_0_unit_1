              Wikipedia defines Pair Programming this way. Pair programming is 
              an agile software development technique in which two programmers 
              work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code 
              while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator,[1] reviews 
              each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch 
              roles frequently.
          </p>
          
          <p>
              There are many reasons why pair programming can be beneficial. 
              Development goes faster as two work more efficiently when one 
              person types and the other guides them. Another reason is that 
              they can share ideas and be more creative; bouncing ideas off
              each other.

              When two programmers pair error are reduced as they can more 
              easily spot errors.

              Pair programming is an industry standard in development and 
              as future junior programmers, we need to learn this skill. So it 
              is good for us to learn this now.

              The downside to pair programming is that the programmers can get
              into conflict when they differ on how things should be done. Also 
              one programmer can dominate the pairing session when they are more
              strong willed than their pair. And it is possible that one 
              could just let the other programmer do the work while they sit 
              back and watch. But overall we believe that the benefits of pair 
              programming outweigh the cons.

            REFLECTION:<br/>
            At first I was a little nervous about pairing, not sure what to expect from the experience.
            But once we got started it was kind of exciting, as we seemed to work well together.
            I actually enjoyed it and am looking forward to trying it again. For David Sin and I, 
            we fell into a role of me driving while he navigated, pulling in images and
            text and ideas for things to add to the page. Things seemed to flow for us in creating this page.<br />
