// I want to get the mean of a set of numbers

// I want to get the median of a set of numbers

// Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines
// It was difficult to try and tell in simple non-technical phrases what was needed to get the test to work.
// I tried to use the function name in the sentence and use the words "set of numbers" to mean array. I do 
// not think that translated as well as it should. I would like to know more about making user stories that
// translate better into acutal code. I did like getting back the final set of code and seeing what it had
// become. It was like the telephone game. We only had one error in the final version, and it was kinda right
// but we ended up with a float for the array index instead of an integer.
