## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
Tells git to add a new file to the local repository on the next commit command. 

#### branch
Tells github, the remote, to split a copy of the code off from the main code so changes can be made to that instead of the main code branch

#### checkout
This lets you switch between branches in the remote.

#### clone
This pulls a local copy of a repository. This would be done on a new local repository pulling a remote with files in it.

#### commit
This checks in changes and new files into a local repository

#### fetch
This pulls any changes to the remote repository since you last pulled a copy. It does not merge those changes into your local repository.

#### log
This displays a log of changes made to a repository

#### merge
This brings a branch back into the main set of code

#### pull
Pulls a remote repository into a local repository adding new files and changing others.

#### push
Pushes local repository changes to a remote repository

#### reset
This undoes the prior commits from a repository. This cannot be done after a push to a remote has been done.

#### rm
This will remove a file from a repository

#### status
Gives the state of changed files and new files in your local repository.

## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository
	git push 
- Fetch changes
	git pull 
- Commit locally
	git commit -m 'my message'

## Release 5: Reflection on what I learned
Git has always been scary for me. There is a lot of commands and you can mess things up if you do not do it correctly. That was shy I like the app. It took the scary out of the process. But this lesson has shown that there are a lot of things that we will need to do that cannot be done through the app. So I am going to use the comand line to push this file to the remote repository and hopefully start using it from now on. I think that branching will be scary also, as far as knowing you are in the branch making changes and not in the main code. I was surprised at the Git documentation as being easy to read and understand from my newbie perspective.
