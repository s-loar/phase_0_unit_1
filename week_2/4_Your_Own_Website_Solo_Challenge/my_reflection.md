Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
Web design and designing for user experience is important to having a successful website. A lot of time can be spent styling a site to create a visually appealing and useful experience.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
I like doing the design improvements to a page. It is fun playing with the page in Chrome dev tools and seeing the changes automaticaly. The responsive changes can be a pain, but each time I do one, it gets easier.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work? 
I wrote the plan of what I would like to see, then did the wireframe and finally applied it to the index.html page. There is not a lot to that page, just a few links. so there was not much to work with. It is difficult to implement much of a design without much content.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
I owuld like to have something to put in a sidebar, and maybe add a footer. And it could use some CSS animations, if there were some kind of content.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
The responsive design changes for the page were difficult to get to work right. But it is nice to see it work when done.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
No other resources.
