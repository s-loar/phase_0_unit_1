# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
The DOM is a convention used by browsers that allows the representation of HTML objects and interacting with them. It is tree structure of tags and attibutes of a web page and this can be interacted with via JavaScript and CSS. It is good to have a structure that allows interaction with HTML to make it something more than just a document that you read like plain text. The bad part is that not all browsers work the same or have the same features available to interact with the DOM.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
My site is less comples and has far less tags, styling and images. so my site was easy to examine and not much to see in the Dev Tools, the WordPress site, http://ishothim.com/, was comples and more of everything to look at in the Dev Tools.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with? The Dev Tools are great for hashing out the look of a page and debugging JavaScript. It's still a little complex to me, but I think a lot of usage will help with that.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
I have played with the Chrome Dev Tools before, but the video training and doing this on my pages has really helped.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
