The questions I asked were several. First, nothing was said of what the content should be, so I decided to reuse the content from #4 where we were introducint ourselves. There was also no mention of which side to put the sidebar, so I just chose to float it to the left of the content.

The concept that I had troube with was what was an acceptable approach to placing the caption text over the image. I started with making the image just the background of the containing div, but changed it after re-reading the instructions. I ended up having the containing div positioned relative to its surrounding elements and then placing the image and text to absolute positions within the containing div. Then I just need to bring up the text with its z-index to put it on top of the image.

Yes, I did learn a new skill in placing the text on top of the image.

I think I am confident about what I have done, but we will see what kind of feedback I get. You never know if you mis-interpreted something, or forgot something.

I enjoyed playing with the content with styles to change the appearance, and float things around. I used Chrome dev tools to change things on the fly in the browser and then pulled those styes into my CSS file.

I found building out the sidebars, and everything from scratch to be a little tedious, as I currently just pull all that into my work, and just concentrate on playing with the content area. But I know that whenever I have to build everthing from scratch like this, I can probably save time on the next pages by re-using that work there.
