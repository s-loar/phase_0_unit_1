## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://s-loar.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I actually have enjoyed this exercise. I often use these sites and never really considered why I like them, and this lesson gave me some insight on what makes me like a site and so I can keep these things in mind as I create my own projects in the future. The actual blog had me worried as to having to make another page from scratch, but I found this one easier, and I tried to make it something I might enjoy looking at, although I think I still have more to learn on that.
