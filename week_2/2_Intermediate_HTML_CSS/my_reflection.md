# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad? I think having web standards are good for developers and good for the people using the internet. It allows a consistent way of doing things to create a consistent experience for users.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not? I understand the sturcture and why the browser needs the HTML to be structured that way. It uses this structure to ease the building of the DOM and rendering of the page on the screen.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not? I like the new tags. They are more natural that the use on only divs. It allows the use of tag names that are easier to understand what the intention of the tags are for.

* Why is reset.css necessary? It removes the default styling that the browsers place on DOM elements. This gives a level starting ground to start styling that will give a more consistent look across browsers.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do? I have used many browsers over the years. Starting with IE5, and the earliest Firefox, to today using Safari, Chrome, Firefox and IE11.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
