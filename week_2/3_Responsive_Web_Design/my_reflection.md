# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
Responsive design is styling a web site to "respond" to different sized screen sizes in that the elements on the page change to better design layout for the device they are being viewed on. Yes this is a good practice. In the old days design was not done for smaller devices and only geared to an average monitor size. Now people want to view websites on all different size devices with different screen sizes and web sites need to be viewable on these too.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
They have chaned web design by making web sites adjust to unlimited screen sizes in order to be useful to the people browsing the web. For the near future web design will have to handle small screens like watches, and larger TV sized screens and it will need to detect and adjust for touch interface devices.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
We should try to adjust our web sites to work for visually impared persons. This might be their best outreach to to the world. But it is difficult for most designers to understand what their experience of the web is.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
Web sites need to be visually pleasing and functional on a large variety of devices. And content is king, as that is what users really come to a web site for.
