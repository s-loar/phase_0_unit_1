## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a repository you click the + sign at the top of the GitHub page; select "create new..." and then select "New Repository".  That takes you to a page where you enter information about your new repository. Enter the repository name, a description and select if comments can be made by others and they type of licensing you want to have.

Open Source is the free sharing of software code.

Open Source is a little scary in that others can see the quality and skill you have in making software and judge you based on that.

Licenses allow you to set some control over how people can use and distribute the code that you have made open sourced.

I have never known what the licenses were for or what the differences were, before now. For struggling, after pulling the repository down to my Macbook, I went looking for it and found it in my users/sloar directory. I would have preferred to place that in a sub-folder like documents/projects, but maybe that will come later.

I have done the training on Git that is in CodeSchool. That was good, but actually I think that what you presented here is a better intro than what I have encountered elsewhere.
