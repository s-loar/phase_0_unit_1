Here is the content of the email I sent:
Hi Guys. My name is Steve Loar. We met on the Hangout call yesterday. This is my introduction to you. I am currently living in Cincinnati, Ohio. 

My favorite Websites are:

My learning style is: Multimodal - Aural(?), read/Write, and Kinesthetic, I think.

Look forward to working with you. Be sure to send your information to me also. 

Steve


Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

I do not see anything about talking about my fears about DBC, so I have not done that anywhere. If the others send something to me, I will respond likewise and then reflect on that here. But if I am to talk about that here and now, I will say that I am concerned about the volume of work and the hours it takes to do this, and will take over the next 18 weeks. Will I be able to get through it, and will there be any jobs on the other side when I am done.
