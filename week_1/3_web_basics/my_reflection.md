## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

the 2 new things I learned were that the internet is a system of interconected computer networks and that it is not the same thing as the Word Wide Web, which is an application that runs on top of the internet to serve web pages to browsers.

Important things to remember are how often will the information need to be updated. A short time between changes might suggest that a web application might be better. ALso you might want to consider if you will support users on older browsers, and if so you may need something like modernizer.js to help things work for them.

When I saw my web page live, I felt accomplishment that i had gottne all the parts to work to get the page to show up. I also felt relief that the page showed up.

I was wondering how changes to repositories got pushed back up to the server. Now I know.

No other resources where consulted.
