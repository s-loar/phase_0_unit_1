# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
Finding the time to do all the DBC work. And still work 40 hours a week, and take care of my aging mother, and goto the gym, and still have friends, and a wife, and a house that needs maintenance.

* How will you combat that? 
I am starting to figure out a workable schedule. I am finding that medation and exercise is helping me stay calm, and relieve stress. and celebrating the completion of each week.

* What techniques will you try?
First I tried doing each unit completely then doing the next. But I am trying breaking it out by activity type. First reading and watching all the material, then doing the web page building part then the reflections.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
I want to make this be a work transition to what I can carry over into the DBC phase 1. Where it is normal for me to start the day at 8 and then work until 11PM or so each day, and do work on the weekends. I think the more I have made this transition before I get to Chicago, the better I will be adjusted for the work schedule there.
