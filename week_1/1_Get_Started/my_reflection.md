## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I did not have a lot of struggles setting up git and GitHub, as I had done that weeks ago when doing the prep work. I did however, drop my GitHub account and create a new one so I could start fresh. Hopefully I did not break anything.

In non-technical terms, git can be described as software that allows one to save versions of computer files and track changes to them. The files are stored in what are called repositories. GitHub is a commercial web site that hosts git repositories.

Version control allows the storage of files and tracks their changes from when they were initially added to the git repositiry. One can also revert to an older version of the file if needed. It also allows collaboration between users on making changes to those files.

Developers use version control to store backup copies of their files, track changes, revert to old copies, and collaborate on projects in a shared place. Such a tool makes sense to me in the development of software. When more than one person is working on something it is necessary to control and track who is doing what. 

This makes sense to me as a developer, and not much does not make sense. In a pratical sense, I will say that I have never seen anyone pull an old version out because the newer version has a bug. Rather the new version is fixed and the repository is then updated.
