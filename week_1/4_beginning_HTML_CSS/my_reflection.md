## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

What makes sense to me is opening and closing tags. It makes everything symmetrical. What does not make sense are tags that do not. If all tags worked the same, then you would not have to worry about which ones need a closing tag and which do not.

What is good is the power that comes from combining tags, classes, and ids with css. That really gives a lot of control over the look of the elements on your page. The bad parts are mostly the confusion over tags that do not require closing tags.

No great "aha" moments, but the cat pictures are very cute.

No outside resources were used.
