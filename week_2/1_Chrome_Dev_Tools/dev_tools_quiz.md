##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS 
  THis can be done from the Elements tab and the Sources tab. The elements tab is split between HTML on the left and  CSS on the right. You can just type in them directly to add things and make changes. The Sources tab opens when you click on a CSS file in the Elements tab/CSS display. Again you can type directly in the displayed CSS. To apply your changes to the browser you must save it. and if wanted, you can save it to an external file.
  
  * Javascript Debugging
  This can be done from the Sources tab, you can set break points and walk through the execution of the JavaScript. You can also use the Console to directly run JavaScript, or view console.log and console.warn statement output.
  
  * Performance Optimization 
  Performance can be improved by looking at the Timeline and Profiles tabs. The timeline let you see the execution time of JavaScript, and the loading of resources like HTML, and images. You can see the memory useage and the CPU usage of these resources. In the Profile tab, you can take and compare Heap snapshots to look for memory leaks. You can also use the Network tab to look for slow loading or executing resources and missing resources that give 404 errors.

* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?
For the Mac, it is cmd + opt + i

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!) 
  It is #0b0f11
  * Tweak the background color to white.done
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.done
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.done
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/ done
  
  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain. It is an image, and so cannot be edited in this way.

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website? 
  * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?
